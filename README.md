# Fourier_&_Wavelet_Domain_Processing
Periodic noise is a significant problem for classical analog image transmission. As the digital image is a 2-D signal, it can be handled using the Fourier theory. This means the image is considered as a sum of infinite sines and cosines, and the Fourier transfer is applicable. Many of the archived footage has significant periodic noise problem due to the interference from powerline or other radio sources.
